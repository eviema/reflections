When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You use a remote repository when you want to share your work with others
    and/or allow others to contribute to your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You want to pull changes from the remote repository only if you're sure
    you want those changes to be added to your local repository. Automatic
    pulling can't determine that for you.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used on GitHub when you don't have the permission to modify
    someone else's repository but want to build on that repository and
    make changes. You fork a branch of the other person's repository so that
    you have a copy on your GitHub account from which you can work
    to make changes.

    Clones are used to copy a branch of a repository that is either 
    on GitHub or on your local computer to your local computer.

    Branches are commit chains with different commit histories. You can access
    a particular commit/version of your program by checkout a branch and
    checkout a commit in there.
